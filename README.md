# Social Media

The Social Media Website is a feature-rich blog platform built using Vue.js. It provides a seamless user experience with functionalities like user authentication, post creation, commenting, replying, and interactive engagement through likes. Users can manage their own content while interacting with others in a structured and user-friendly interface.

## Features

### **User Authentication**

- Secure **sign-up** and **login** system.
- Ensures only **authenticated users** can interact with posts and comments.

### **Post, Comment, Reply Management**

- **Create, Edit & Delete**: Users can create, update, and remove their own posts, comments, and replies.
- **Engagement**: Users can **like** posts, comments, and replies.
- **Discussion**: Users can comment on posts and reply to comments for interactive conversations.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
